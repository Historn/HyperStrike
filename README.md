# 🎮 HyperStrike

**HyperStrike** is a fast-paced, competitive 3v3 multiplayer arena game developed as a Final Degree Project (TFG) by three students from **Barcelona** at the **Image Processing and Multimedia Technology Center (CITM)**, part of the **Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC)**.

The game blends high-mobility hero shooter mechanics with ball-based objectives in futuristic arenas, combining elements of **Overwatch-style abilities** and **Rocket League-style physics gameplay**.
